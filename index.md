#Testing

This is a test

> ## Exploring More `ls` Flags
>
> You can also use two options at the same time. What does the command `ls` do when used
> with the `-l` option? What about if you use both the `-l` and the `-h` option?
>
> Some of its output is about properties that we do not cover in this lesson (such
> as file permissions and ownership), but the rest should be useful
> nevertheless.
>
> > ## Solution
> > The `-l` option makes `ls` use a **l**ong listing format, showing not only
> > the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
> > and the time of its last modification. If you use both the `-h` option and the `-l` option,
> > this makes the file size '**h**uman readable', i.e. displaying something like `5.3K`
> > instead of `5369`.
